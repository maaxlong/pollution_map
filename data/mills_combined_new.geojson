Our works are not affected by floods. Obtain supply of water from wells sunk to about 60 yards, from bore-holes below the coal workings, and a small quantity from springs; and consume yearly, 450,000,000 gallons. The whole of the water consumed, viz., 450,000,000 gallons, after being used for dyeing and washing purposes, is discharged into the Beck. We have depositing tanks for our own convenience, and the water they contain is used for condensing purposes at the mills situated below our works. We use yearly from 800 to 900 tons of woods and other solid dye-wares, 400 to 500 tons of alum, 100 tons of potash, soda, sulphate of copper, ammonia, glauber salts, and soap. We also use 400 tons of sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids. The soapsuds cannot be separated in our operations, and therefore cannot be treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, about 1,000 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 21,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used principally as ballast for railways. The excrements of our workpeople are collected, and used as manure on land. I do not see how pollution can be avoided in our case, except by stopping our works.
